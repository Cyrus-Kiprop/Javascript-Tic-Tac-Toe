# Rules

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

# How to play

When you start the game, it's going to ask the name of the player1 and player2, and immediately after, a match will start.
You can play as many matches as you want in a single game, and the game is going to show a Winners or a Draw depending on the game result.

## Making a move

We have 9 cell on the board as represented below.

    |1|2|3|
    |4|5|6|
    |7|8|9|

The Player1 will start the game with 'X' mark on any of the 9 cell, once the player makes his change, the user gets toggled to player2 and so on. You can't re-assign a cell once you make the move or once the mark is placed for either 'X'or'O'.

## Ending the game

The match is over if the winnning critera is met, or else the match will be a draw. One east result user gets an option to either 'Reset' or 'Restart' the game.

Reset - The data of Players will be not saved and the user need to provide the entire data once more at the beggining.
Restart- The player is taken back to thr board, and the players can replay the game.
